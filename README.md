# Voting-system
Voting system using blockchain

This project is a simple blockchain-based voting system implemented in Solidity. The contract allows users to vote for candidates using their Ethereum addresses (via MetaMask). At the end of the voting period, the contract calculates and announces the candidate with the highest vote count.


**Some features of it :**
-> Candidate Management: Initialize and manage candidates.
-> Voting: Users can vote for candidates using their Ethereum address.
-> Vote Tracking: Prevents users from voting more than once.
-> Voting Status: Admin can end the voting period.
-> Vote Retrieval: Users can query vote counts for candidates.
